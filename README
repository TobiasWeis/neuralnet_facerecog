NN_Tobi_Mariam_Mirror.py is a runnable executable, 
the ipynb are the ipython notebooks for visualization

~/.theanorc:
[global]
device=gpu
floatX=float32
allow_gc=True 

[nvcc]
fastmath = True

[cuda]
root=/usr/local/cuda-7.5/

allow_gc has to be True in my case, otherwise the model does not fit in the GPU
