NN_Tobi_Mariam_Mirror.py is a runnable executable, 
the ipynb are the ipython notebooks for visualization

This code uses Theano and Lasagne to recognize faces in front of a smartmirror.
Faces are detected using OpenCVs Haarcascade classifier.

General workflow for training and setup:

PIR motion sensor -> start Facedumper.py -> save face-images to disk

get face-images -> classify with existing net -> put into preliminary folders -> manual inspection, move to GT folders -> retrain


~/.theanorc:
[global]
device=gpu
floatX=float32
allow_gc=True 

[nvcc]
fastmath = True

[cuda]
root=/usr/local/cuda-7.5/

allow_gc has to be True in my case, otherwise the model does not fit in the GPU
